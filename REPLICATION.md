SUMMARY
-------

Data description
----------------

### Data Sources

- [ ] Data files mentioned, provided. File names listed below
  - familyincome1978.dta
  - longtermindex.dta
  - weight94.dta

### Analysis Data Files

- [ ] Analysis data files mentioned, provided. File names listed below.
  - nlsy79rawdata.dta
  - NLSY79_analysis_ed.dta

Data deposit
------------

> INSTRUCTIONS: Most deposits will be at openICPSR, but all need to be checked for complete metadata. Detailed guidance is at [https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html). 

### Requirements 

No data deposit at openICPSR

No README

- [REQUIRED] Produce README and data deposit

### Deposit Metadata

- [NOTE] openICPSR metadata is sufficient/nonexistent


Data checks
-----------

Data are present and can be read
Stored in dta forrmat
Data have variable labels attached

Code description
----------------

There are four provided stata do files:
  anchecks.do
  annlsy79.do
  datanlsy79ed.do
  grformat.do
  main.do (nests all other do files in it)

- Program code does not identify which figure is produced by which program or line

- Neither the program codes, nor the README, identify which tables are produced by what program.

Stated Requirements
---------------------

- [ ] No requirements specified



Actual Requirements, if different
---------------------------------


- [ ] Software Requirements 
  - [ ] Stata
    -command: parallel
  
> [REQUIRED] Please amend README to contain complete requirements. 

Computing Environment of the Replicator
---------------------

> - (Windows) by right-clicking on "This PC"

- Stata/MP 15

Replication steps
-----------------

1. Downloaded code from URL provided.
2. Downloaded data from URL provided. 
3. Ran code in the order detailed in the main.do file
4. annlsy79.do file did not run

Findings
--------

### Data Preparation Code

- datanlsy79ed.do ran as expected. Produced cleaned data

### Tables


### Figures

- Figure 4: Looks the same
- Figure 5: Looks the same
- Figure 13: Looks the same

Other figures: program not provided, or program mulfunctioned

### In-Text Numbers

[ ] There are in-text numbers, but they are not identified in the code




Classification
--------------

- [ ] partial reproduction: large parts of the paper cannot be replicated

### Reason for incomplete reproducibility

> INSTRUCTIONS: mark the reasons here why full reproduciblity was not achieved, and enter this information in JIRA

- [ ] `Code not functional`. There is a bug in one of the ADO files (not clear which one) which prevents the code from running
